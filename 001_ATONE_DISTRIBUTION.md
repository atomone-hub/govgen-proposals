Based on the snapshot just at the conclusion of proposal 848 on the Cosmos Hub;

(1) YES gets 1x, (2) NO gets 3x, (3) NWV gets no bonus or a nomimal bonus less
than 5%, (4) abstain voters and non-voters get a blend in accordance with the
actual distribution of YES / NO+NWV votes (not accounting for any NWV bonus),
except (5) non-voters might get a slight penalty of up to 5% compared to
abstain voters.

This leaves two issues to be solved for in a separate proposal; (a) the NWV
nominal bonus, if any, and (b) non-voters get a slight penalty, if any.
