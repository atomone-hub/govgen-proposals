    * Publish the AtomOne's proposed tokenomics and submit it to Govgen for vote (feedback and sentiment).
    * Publish the AtomOne's software choice proposal and submit it to Govgen for vote (feedback and sentiment).
    * Publish the AtomOne's supply distribution proposal and submit it to Govgen for vote (feedback and sentiment).
    * Publish the AtomOne proposed completed Constitution and submit it to Govgen for vote (feedback and sentiment).
2. **Complete the burn mechanism spec from ATONE to Photon- 10% completed**

## Phase 0: AtomOne Chain Launch

1. **Launch**
    * Launch the AtomOne chain with a simple Gaia fork and no, to minimal changes with ICS and IBC functionalities disabled. 
    * Ratify all governance documents on the AtomOne chain: Articles of Constitution and if required the proposed AtomOne roadmap and tokenomics
<br>

## **Phase 1: Implementation**

1. **New features/changes implemented**
    * Governance improvements
    * PHOTON mechanics
    * IBC, including relay & fee-based spam prevention. 
    * Audit all of the above
2. **Photon activation**
    * ATONE -> PHOTON burn mechanism enabled
    * ATONE only used as fees for PHOTON burn tx
    * All fees collected in PHOTONs

3. **DAO Activation**

    * Complete the Charters for the Steering, Oversight, and the first Treasury DAO - The Buidl DAO* and submit them to AtomOne for vote
    * Complete the Law documents for the proposed MVP DAOs and submit them to AtomOne for vote.
    * Approval of DAO members. 
        * Propose through AtomOne:
            1. Steering Committee Members
            2. Oversight Committee Members
            3. The first Treasury DAO - The Buidl DAO Committee Members
        * Set up individual addresses for all Steering, Oversight members and for the first Treasury DAO - The Buidl DAO and KYC if needed
    * Launch the SteeringDAO, the Oversight DAO and the first Treasury DAO - The Buidl DAO with on-chain representation (AtomOne multisig addresses for each DAO)  
    * Enable full functionality for root chain proposals. Ex:
        * Steering DAO can comment on root proposals.
        * Oversight DAO can halt root proposals.
        * Introduce new proposal types: Constitution, Law.
        * Introduce new transaction types: ex: Bend Time 
    * Compile Constitution and afferent laws on-chain.
    * Maintain an off-chain system that stores the Constitution laws and charters.
<br>

## Phase 2: Validators, ICS Mechanics

1. **Validator Incentives**
    * Fix validator incentives and election mechanics.
    * Implement rewards not strictly proportional to stake to avoid large validator dominance.

2. **ICS**
    * Propose the spec for the improved ICS model that:
        1. ensures more or equal ICS rewards for validators.
        2. collects and distributes ICS rewards according to work performed.
        3. uses photons for all payments.
    * Deploy above ICS on AtomOne.
    * Start draft on ICS++ specification w/ ABCI application containers.
        1. ICS++ consumer chains are described by a linux container.
        2. Develop orchestration tooling for ICS++
        3. Ensure TM1 &lt;-> TM2 IBC compatibility
        4. Expand choice of supported consensus engines for consumer chains. (Hub runs TM1, initial ICS++ consumer chains run TM2 invisibly)
<br>

## Phase 3: Cross-Zone Governance

1. **Expanded Oversight of the DAOs**
    * Allow Oversight DAO to reject proposals from other zones via root/core.
    * Enable Steering DAO to manage root hub parameters and pass them through IBC to shard treasury DAOs.
2. **Enable the creation and functionality of the other Treasury DAOs**
    * Enable the needed functionality for the creation of any treasury DAOs
