# Proposal [PROPOSAL-NUMBER]: [TITLE]

<!--
This template is designed to draft a text proposal for AtomOne. This draft will
be used to start discussions and potentially submit it on the GovGen chain. 

It is a blend between the proposal content we can see in the Cosmos forums, and
the more technical ADR (Architecture Decision Records). The intent of such a
mix is to ensure that proposers go into all the details of their proposals.

A GovGen text proposal has a voting period of 365 days, requires a min deposit
of 50 $GOVGEN that will need to come from the initial onchain proposer, 
and a total deposit of 5,000 $GOVGEN that can be permissionlessly funded
by any account with balance with arbitrary amounts.

## Context
<!--
This section describes the forces at play, including technological, political,
social, and project local. These forces are probably in tension, and should be
called out as such. The language in this section is value-neutral. It is simply
describing facts. It should clearly explain the problem and motivation that the
proposal aims to resolve.

## Consequences
<!--
This section describes the resulting context, after applying the decision. All
consequences should be listed here, not just the "positive" ones. A particular
decision may have positive, negative, and neutral consequences, but all of them
affect the team and project in the future.
